## medical chatbot using biobert
In this project, an intricate and effective multi-step process is employed to deliver comprehensive and contextually relevant responses to user queries. The journey begins with users inputting their questions into 
the chatbot interface. The questions then undergo analysis by the BioBERT model, a specialized pre-trained language model tailored for biomedical text. This initial step ensures a nuanced understanding of queries 
related to the field of biomedicine. The output from BioBERT, representing the contextual comprehension of the biomedical question, is subsequently channeled through a question embedding extractor. This component refines the raw output, capturing essential features and nuances, and generates a condensed question embedding. The refined question embedding is then fed into the GPT-2 model, a powerful language generation model 
developed by OpenAI. GPT-2 excels in understanding and generating human-like text based on the provided context. Leveraging this capability, the model processes the condensed question embedding and produces a 
detailed and coherent response. The final generated answer, a result of the chatbot's ability to comprehend the context and draw on vast knowledge, is presented to the user as the conclusive response to their 
original question. 

This intricate architecture combines the specialized strengths of BioBERT in biomedical text analysis with the versatile language generation prowess of GPT-2, ensuring the chatbot can adeptly handle both domain-specific queries and general language understanding tasks.
